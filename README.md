      * SECT. III. Implicit Faith belongs to Fools, and Truth is comprehended by examining Principles.

      * SECT. IV. The Rights of particular Nations cannot ſubſiſt, if General Principles contrary to them are receiv'd as true.

      * SECT. V. To depend upon the Will of a Man is Slavery.

      *   SECT. XI. No Man comes to command many, unleſs by Conſent or by Force.

      * SECT. XVII. God having given the Government of the World to no one Man, nor declar'd how it ſhould be divided, left it to the VVill of Man.

    _ CHAP. II.

      * SECT. III. Government is not inſtituted for the good of the Governor, but of the Governed; and Power is not an Advantage, but a Burden.

      *   SECT. IV. The Paternal Right devolves to, and is inherited by all the Children.

      * SECT. V. Freemen join together and frame greater or leſſer Societys, and give ſuch Forms to them as beſt pleaſe themſelves.

      * SECT. IX. The Government inſtituted by God over the Iſraelites was Ariſtocratical.

      * SECT. XVIII. Xenophon in blaming the Diſorders of Democracys, favours Ariſtocracys, not Monarchys.

      * SECT. XIX. That Corruption and Venality which is natural to Courts, is ſeldom found in Popular Governments.

      * SECT. XX. Man's natural love to Liberty is temper'd by Reaſon, which originally is his Nature.

      * SECT. XXI. Mix'd and Popular Governments preſerve Peace, and manage Wars, better than Abſolute Monarchys.

    _ CHAP. III.  

      * SECT. I. Kings not being Fathers of their People, nor excelling all others in Vertue, can have no other juſt Power than what the Laws give; nor any title to the privileges of the Lord's Anointed.

      * SECT. II. The Kings of Iſrael and Judah were under a Law not ſafely to be tranſgreſt.

      * SECT. III. Samuel did not deſcribe to the Iſraelites the glory of a free Monarchy; but the Evils the People ſhould ſuffer, that he might divert them from deſiring a King.

      *   SECT. IV. No People can be oblig'd to ſuffer from their Kings what they have not a right to do.

      * SECT. V. The Miſchiefs ſuffer'd from wicked Kings are ſuch as render it both reaſonable and juſt for all Nations that have Vertue and Power, to exert both in repelling them.

      * SECT. VI. 'Tis not good for ſuch Nations as will have Kings, to ſuffer them to be glorious, powerful, or abounding in Riches.

      * SECT. VII. When the Iſraelites ask'd for ſuch a King as the Nations about them had, they ask'd for a Tyrant, tho they did not call him ſo.

      * SECT. VIII. Under the name of Tribute no more is underſtood than what the Law of each Nation gives to the ſupreme Magiſtrate for the defraying of publick Charges; to which the Cuſtoms of the Romans, or ſufferings of the Jews have no relation.

      * SECT. IX. Our own Laws confirm to us the enjoyment of our native Rights.

      *   SECT. X. The words of St. Paul enjoining obedience to higher Powers, favor all ſorts of Governments no leſs than Monarchy.

      * SECT. XI. That which is not juſt, is not Law; and that which is not Law, ought not to be obey'd.

      * SECT. XII. The Right and Power of a Magiſtrate depends upon his Inſtitution, not upon his Name.

      * SECT. XIII. Laws were made to direct and inſtruct Magiſtrats, and, if they will not be directed, to reſtrain them.

      *   SECT. XIV. Laws are not made by Kings, not becauſe they are buſy'd in greater matters than doing Juſtice, but becauſe Nations will be govern'd by Rule, and not Arbitrarily.

      * SECT. XV. A general preſumption that Kings will govern well, is not a ſufficient ſecurity to the People.

      * SECT. XVI. The obſervation of the Laws of Nature is abſurdly expected from Tyrants, who ſet themſelves up againſt all Laws: and he that ſubjects Kings to no other Law than what is common to Tyrants, deſtroys their being.

      * SECT. XVII. Kings cannot be the Interpreters of the Oaths they take.

      * SECT. XVIII.   The next in blood to deceas'd Kings cannot generally be ſaid to be Kings till they are crown'd.

      * SECT. XIX. The greateſt Enemy of a juſt Magiſtrate is he who endeavours to invalidate the Contract between him and the People, or to corrupt their Manners.

      * SECT. XX. Unjuſt Commands are not to be obey'd; and no man is oblig'd to ſuffer for not obeying ſuch as are againſt Law.

      * SECT. XXI. It cannot be for the good of the People that the Magiſtrate have a power above the Law: and he is not a Magiſtrate who has not his power by Law.

      * SECT. XXII.   The rigor of the Law is to be temper'd by men of known integrity and judgment, and not by the Prince who may be ignorant or vicious.

      * SECT. XXIII. Ariſtotle proves, that no man is to be intruſted with an abſolute Power, by ſhewing that no one knows how to execute it, but ſuch a man as is not to be found.

      * SECT. XXIV. The Power of Auguſtus Ceſar was not given, but uſurp'd.

      * SECT. XXV. The Regal Power was not the firſt in this Nation; nor neceſſarily to be continu'd, tho it had bin the firſt.

      * SECT. XXVI. Tho the King may be entruſted with the power of chuſing Judges, yet that by which they act is from the Law.

      * SECT. XXVII. Magna Charta was not the Original, but a Declaration of the Engliſh Libertys. The King's Power is not reſtrain'd, but created by that and other Laws; and the Nation that made them can only correct the defects of them.

      * SECT. XXVIII. The Engliſh Nation has always bin govern'd by it ſelf, or its Repreſentatives.

      * SECT. XXIX.   The King was never Maſter of the Soil.

      * SECT. XXX. Henry the Firſt was King of England by as good a Title as any of his Predeceſſors or Succeſſors.

      * SECT. XXXI. Free Nations have a right of meeting, when and where they pleaſe, unleſs they deprive themſelves of it.

      *   SECT. XXXII. The Powers of Kings are ſo various according to the Conſtitutions of ſeveral States, that no Conſequence can be drawn to the prejudice or advantage of any one, merely from the Name.

      * SECT. XXXIII. The Liberty of a People is the Gift of God and Nature.

      * SECT. XXXIV. No Veneration paid, or Honor confer'd upon a juſt and lawful Magiſtrate, can diminiſh the Liberty of a Nation.

      * SECT. XXXV. The Authority given by our Law to the Acts perform'd by a King de facto, detract nothing from the Peoples right of creating whom they pleaſe.

      *   SECT. XXXVI. The general revolt of a Nation cannot be call'd a Rebellion.

      * SECT. XXXVII. The Engliſh Government was not ill conſtituted, the defects more lately obſerv'd proceeding from the change of manners, and corruption of the times.

      * SECT. XXXVIII.   The power of calling and diſſolving Parliaments is not ſimply in the King. The variety of Cuſtoms in chuſing Parliament men, and the Errors a People may commit, neither prove that Kings are or ought to be Abſolute.

      * SECT. XXXIX. Thoſe Kings only are heads of the People, who are good, wiſe, and ſeek to advance no Intereſt but that of the Publick.

      * SECT. XL. Good Laws preſcribe eaſy and ſafe Remedys againſt the Evils proceeding from the vices or infirmitys of the Magiſtrate; and when they fail, they muſt be ſupply'd.

      * SECT. XLI.   The People for whom and by whom the Magiſtrate is created, can only judg whether he rightly perform his Office or not.

      * SECT. XLII.   The Perſon that wears the Crown cannot determin the Affairs which the Law refers to the King.

      * SECT. XLIII. Proclamations are not Laws.

      * SECT. XLIV. A People that is not free cannot ſubſtitute Delegats.

      *   SECT. XLV. The Legiſlative Power is always Arbitrary, and not to be truſted in the hands of any who are not bound to obey the Laws they make.

      * SECT. XLVI. The coercive power of the Law proceeds from the Authority of Parliament.
